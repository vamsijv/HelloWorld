Github Tutorial For Beginners:
------------------------------
Basic Commands: Execute all commands(clone) in github repo from cmd

git clone: Execute this in folder where u want to copy the github repo
git status: Compares the local repo with server copy and identifies the which files are different
git add YOUR_FILENAME: adds/updates the changes to a file mentioned(YOUR_FILENAME)
	use -A instead of YOUR_FILENAME to include all files
git commit -m "YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE": commits locally your changes to repo
	In case you forgot to give YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE, cmd prompt takes you to different screen where u need to enter the commit message. and then type "esc:wq" to get back to the normal screen.
git push: pushes local copy to github server
git pull: pulls content from github server to local repo
	Incase of conflict between server and local copy of a file, the file in local copy is updated with both the changes. Content just below 'Head' indicates the local copy and beneath it is server copy. Merge the changes finally to save the final/correct version in local copy. Once conflict is resolved, commit local copy to server using push commands(use add, commit commands before push command if needed)

git checkout BRANCH_NAME
	switches locally into BRANCH_NAME
git checkout -
	switches locally into last accessed branch
git branch -a
	list all branches - remote and local. Branch with * prefixed to its name in output is current branch
git branch
	list all local branches. Branch with * prefixed to its name in output is current branch
